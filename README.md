# Fine-Tuning-BERT-for-Text-Classification
This project involves fine-tuning a pre-trained BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model for a text classification task on a given dataset. The goal is to adapt BERT to classify Arabic text inputs into predefined categories by training it on a labeled dataset(Positive, Negative,Mixed) .
